Text: Other People Magazine is a bi - annual publication celebrating everything that makes us different and all that connects us, what drives us and what gives us purpose. Our vision and motivation are what makes that journey unique. The process of discovery and story telling is a common one. Join us on that journey through collaboration and participation and by being part of a fundamentally human experience. We are both collaborators and facilitators.
